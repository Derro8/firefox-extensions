## Unable to change subtitles
Unfortunately the video player is within an iframe and firefox doesn't block those requests for some reason, so you'll need to visit the [preferences](https://www.crunchyroll.com/account/preferences) page and change `Subtitles/CC Language` in the `Video` section to whatever language you want it to be in.
